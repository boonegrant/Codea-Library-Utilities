ChangeLog
=========

v2.0 Split into separate projects: "Library Utilities" is for
     useful things of a general nature.

v1.0 Converted to use toadkick's cmodule for importing 
     and Briarfox's AutoGist for versionning.
     It needs toadkick's code from 
        https://gist.github.com/apendley/5411561
     tested with version 0.0.8
     To use without AutoGist, comment out the lines in setup.
